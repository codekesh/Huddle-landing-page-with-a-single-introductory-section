## My process
Below is my process for making this page clone
1. As usual I created a HTML and 2 css files and linked these CSS files with HTML file with help of media query.
2. I add content in HTML.
3. I added class for social media refer from font-awesome.
4. In both CSS files I used CSS custom properties for styling and for hover used trasnsition effect.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transition
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Used learn transition effect and learnt how to add icon by just simply write class name.

```html
<i class="fa-brands fa-border fa-facebook-f">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transition: 0.2s ease;
  color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
  border-color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
}
```

### Continued development
I will continue this journey and learn some more skills
